/// The runtime API provides different services to the et-soc devices, allowing the user to manage device memory (see
/// mallocDeviceId and freeDeviceId), load executable elfs into the device (see loadCode and unloadCode) and execute
/// workloads in an asynchronous fashion. These workloads typically consist on copying memory from the host to the
/// device (see memcpyHostToDeviceId), launching a kernel (see kernelLaunch) and getting the results back from the
/// device to the host (see  memcpyDeviceIdToHost) Different workloads can be run asynchronously and potentially in
/// parallel, using streams. Every operation is asynchronous, there are also primitives to allow synchronization between
/// the host and the device (see waitForEventId and streamFlush)
